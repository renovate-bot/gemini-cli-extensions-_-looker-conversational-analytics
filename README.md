# Gemini CLI Extension - Looker Conversational Analytics

> [!NOTE]
> This extension is currently in beta (pre-v1.0), and may see breaking changes until the first stable release (v1.0).

This Gemini CLI extension provides a set of tools to interact with [Looker](https://cloud.google.com/looker/docs) instances. It allows you to manage your Looks, dashboards, and explores directly from the [Gemini CLI](https://google-gemini.github.io/gemini-cli/), using natural language prompts.

## Why Use the Looker Extension?

* **Seamless Workflow:** Stay in your CLI. No need to constantly switch contexts.
* **Connect to Looker:** Securely connect to your Looker instances.
* **Natural Language Usage:** Stop wrestling with complex commands. List models, explores, and dimensions, and run Looks and queries by describing what you want in plain English.


## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

* [Gemini CLI](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli) installed with version **+v0.6.0**.
* Setup Gemini CLI [Authentication](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#-authentication-options).
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (the MCP server runs via `npx`).
* A Looker instance with API access enabled.
    You will need a Looker Client Id and Client Secret. These can be obtained by following the directions at [Looker API authentication](https://cloud.google.com/looker/docs/api-auth#authentication_with_an_sdk).

* A Google Cloud project with the appropriate APIs enabled.
    You will need a Google Cloud project with the appropriate APIS enabled. Use the following command to enable those APIs:
    ```
    gcloud services enable geminidataanalytics.googleapis.com --project=$PROJECT_ID
    gcloud services enable cloudaicompanion.googleapis.com --project=$PROJECT_ID
    ```

    In addition to [setting the ADC for your server][set-adc], you need to ensure the IAM identity has been given the following IAM roles (or corresponding permissions):
    - `roles/looker.instanceUser`
    - `roles/cloudaicompanion.user`
    - `roles/geminidataanalytics.dataAgentStatelessUser`

    To initialize the application default credential run `gcloud auth login --update-adc` in your environment before starting MCP Toolbox.

## Getting Started

### Installation

To install the extension, use the command:

```bash
gemini extensions install https://github.com/gemini-cli-extensions/looker-conversational-analytics
```

### Configuration

You will be prompted to configure the following settings during installation. These settings are saved in an `.env` file within the extension's directory.

*   `LOOKER_BASE_URL`: The URL of your Looker instance (e.g. `https://looker.example.com`). You may need to add the port, i.e. `:19999`.
*   `LOOKER_CLIENT_ID`: Your Looker Client ID.
*   `LOOKER_CLIENT_SECRET`: Your Looker Client Secret.
*   `LOOKER_VERIFY_SSL`: (Optional) Whether to verify SSL certificates. Defaults to `true`.
*   `LOOKER_PROJECT`: The Google Cloud Project ID.
*   `LOOKER_LOCATION`: The Google Cloud Location ID.

To view or update your configuration:

**List Settings:**
*   Terminal: `gemini extensions list`
*   Gemini CLI: `/extensions list`

**Update Settings:**
*   Terminal: `gemini extensions config looker-conversational-analytics [setting name] [--scope <scope>]`
    *   `setting name`: (Optional) The single setting to configure.
    *   `scope`: (Optional) The scope of the setting in (`user` or `workspace`). Defaults to `user`.
*   Currently, you must restart the Gemini CLI for changes to take effect. We recommend using `gemini --resume` to resume your session.

Alternatively, you can manually set these environment variables before starting the Gemini CLI:

```bash
export LOOKER_BASE_URL="<your-looker-instance-url>"  # e.g. `https://looker.example.com`. You may need to add the port, i.e. `:19999`.
export LOOKER_CLIENT_ID="<your-looker-client-id>"
export LOOKER_CLIENT_SECRET="<your-looker-client-secret>"
export LOOKER_VERIFY_SSL="true" # Optional, defaults to true
export LOOKER_PROJECT="<your-google-cloud-project-id>"
export LOOKER_LOCATION="<your-google-cloud-location-id>"
```

> [!NOTE]
> * Ensure [Application Default Credentials](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/gcloud) are available in your environment.
> * See [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) for debugging your configuration.

### Start Gemini CLI

To start the Gemini CLI, use the following command:

```bash
gemini
```

## Usage
You can ask questions and give commands such as these:

1. What models are available in my Looker instance?
2. What explores are available in *model_name*?
2. What questions can I ask of the explore *explore_name* in model *model_name*?

## Supported Tools

* `get_models`: Use this tool to list the LookML models in Looker.
* `get_explores`: Use this tool to list the explores in a given model.
* `ask_data_insights`: Use this tool to ask a natural language questions of an explore.

## Troubleshooting

Use `gemini --debug` to enable debugging.

Common issues:

* "failed to find default credentials: google: could not find default credentials.": Ensure [Application Default Credentials](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/gcloud) are available in your environment. See [Set up Application Default Credentials](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/external/set-up-adc) for more information.
* "✖ Error during discovery for server: MCP error -32000: Connection closed": The database connection has not been established. Ensure your configuration is set via environment variables.
* "✖ MCP ERROR: Error: spawn npx ENOENT": Node.js/`npx` is not installed or not on your `PATH`. Install Node.js (which provides `npx`).
* "npm error"/network failures on first run: `npx` fetches `@toolbox-sdk/server` on first launch, so it needs network access. Retry once connectivity is available.
